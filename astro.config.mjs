  // NOTE: A previous attempt at `security.csp` shipped a hash-based CSP

  // missed at least one runtime-generated inline script (probably from
  // ClientRouter view-transitions) and one inline style, which the browser
  // then blocked — breaking theme bootstrap and various islands. The
  // current `public/_headers` carries a `frame-ancestors` CSP for the
  // Sanity iframe-pane preview, which is enough for the actual security
  // surface. Re-enabling a full CSP needs an audit of every inline script
  // (incl. ClientRouter's runtime scripts), or a switch to a nonce-based
  // SSR strategy. Not worth chasing for the cookie/csp-xss informational
  // warnings — our Lighthouse runs already score Best Practices 100.
