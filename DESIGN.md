# Reid Design: visual system

How the site looks and why, written 2026-09-29 with the art-direction rebuild.
Strategy (who it is for, the voice, anti-references) is in `PRODUCT.md`; the
audit and the two prototype directions are in
`docs/design/2026-09-29-art-direction.md`. Read this before building any page
or section, and update it in the same change when the system moves.

## The idea

**The craft is the identity.** The site borrows the objects of an interior
designer's working day: paint chips, the fan deck, fabric swatches, sample
tags, the tape measure, the logo's leaf sprig. They are the graphic system, so
nothing here could belong to another studio. Staci is the brand (lead with her
and with tight material crops); prices are said out loud; every fold has one
job.

Chosen direction: **the merge** of prototype B's hero, type and bronze
confidence with prototype A's paint chips, tape measure and sample tags
(Nathan, 2026-09-29).

## Colour: one paint strip

Warm Bronze stays the house colour (Nathan's constraint), now as a seven-tone
ramp. Tokens are in `src/styles/globals.css` (`@theme`), usable as Tailwind
utilities (`bg-chip-6`, `text-ink`).

| Token            | Hex       | Name        | Use                                                        |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--color-chip-1` | `#f1e7dc` | Linen       | palest chip, hover surfaces                                |
| `--color-chip-2` | `#e2cfbd` | Oat         | tape measure, accent text on Walnut / ink                  |
| `--color-chip-3` | `#cdb09a` | Sandbar     | chips, accent text on ink                                  |
| `--color-chip-4` | `#b39079` | Saddle      | chips                                                      |
| `--color-chip-5` | `#9c7661` | Warm Bronze | the house colour: fan deck, pins, rules, display type only |
| `--color-chip-6` | `#80604f` | Walnut      | home hero ground, closing CTA ground, bronze pill          |
| `--color-chip-7` | `#5f4639` | Espresso    | deepest chip, emphasis text on linen                       |
| `--color-ink`    | `#231e1b` | Ink         | text, the testimonial band, the footer                     |
| `--color-ink-2`  | `#5a4e46` | Ink 2       | secondary text                                             |
| `--color-cream`  | `#f5ede3` | Cream       | text on Walnut, Espresso and ink                           |
| `--color-paper`  | `#fffdfa` | Paper       | chip labels, sample tags, the services band                |
| `--color-rule`   | `#e2d8cc` | Rule        | hairlines on linen                                         |
| `--color-bg`     | `#f7f3ee` | Linen       | page ground                                                |

**Contrast rules (computed WCAG ratios, 2026-09-29):**

- Ink on linen 14.9, ink 2 on linen 7.3, Espresso on linen 7.9, Walnut on linen 5.1.
- Ink on chips 1 to 4: 13.5, 10.9, 8.1, 5.6. Cream on Walnut 4.9, on Espresso 7.5, on ink 14.2.
- **Warm Bronze takes no body-size text.** Ink on it is 4.07 and cream 3.50, so both fail AA. It carries display type, fills and marks only. This is why the home hero ground is Walnut and why paint-chip faces skip chip 5. The axe suite caught an earlier wrong note that claimed otherwise.
- The accent colour (`.r-accent`) defaults to Walnut on light grounds. Components on dark grounds set `--accent-color`: Oat on Walnut (3.75, display size only) and Sandbar on ink.

**Light only.** One art-directed theme (the FBCM precedent). The `.dark` tokens
stay dormant in `globals.css`, and the ink footer applies `.dark` to its own
subtree on purpose so its utilities invert. `tests/a11y-dark.spec.ts` guards
that a stored "dark" preference never engages dark mode.

## Type

| Role    | Face                                          | Where                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Display | Zodiak Light 300 (+ true italic), Regular 400 | every heading, prices, big quotes |
| Text    | General Sans 400 / 500 / 600                  | body, UI, labels, buttons         |

- Both are Fontshare fonts under the ITF Free Font License 2.0. **The files are
  not in git** (the licence forbids redistribution via a public repository).
  `scripts/fetch-fonts.mjs` downloads them into gitignored `public/fonts/` on
  `predev` and `prebuild` and checks SHA-256 against `scripts/fonts.lock.json`.
  Licensee is Reid Design LLC, for reiddesignllc.com.
- Metric-matched fallbacks (`Zodiak Fallback`, `General Sans Fallback`) are
  measured in Chrome, so the font swap moves nothing (home CLS 0.002).
- Scale tokens: `--text-display` clamp(3.2rem → 7rem, hero only), `--text-h1`,
  `--text-h2` clamp(2.4rem → 5rem), `--text-h3`, `--text-lede`. Headings are
  weight 300 with -0.025 to -0.035em tracking; scale carries emphasis, not weight.
- **Accent phrase.** Staci's `scriptAccent` fields now set the phrase in Zodiak
  italic (`font-script` utility, `.r-accent` class). No script font anywhere.
- **No tracked small-caps eyebrows** above sections. Where a small line is
  needed it is sentence case, 500 weight, sometimes led by a short rule.

## Primitives (`src/styles/reid.css`)

- `.r-wrap`: page container, max 85rem, fluid gutter (16px on a phone).
- `.r-btn` + `--ink` (default on light), `--cream` (on Walnut or ink), `--bronze`
  (Walnut, reads on both linen and ink). Pills, 46px tall, arrow nudges on hover.
  `CtaLink.astro` renders these for every CMS button (primary = pill,
  secondary = `.r-link`).
- `.r-link`: underline link that draws away on hover.
- `.r-display`, `.r-h2`, `.r-h3`, `.r-lede`, `.r-accent`, `.r-muted`.
- `.r-tag`: the sample tag (paper, notched left edge, punched hole). Used for
  captions on photos and Staci's name on her portrait.
- `.r-rise` via `RiseWords.astro`: page-opening headline split into words on the
  server; each word rises into its own clip box.

## Signature components (home)

- `home/HomeHero.astro`: Walnut ground, headline with Oat-italic accent, the
  `heroPortrait` photo on the right, and a CSS fan deck of the seven named tones
  opening from the seam. Phone: photo on top, copy below.
- `home/HomeStaci.astro`: tall portrait with a sample tag, the first paragraph
  as a Zodiak lede.
- `home/PaintChips.astro`: services as a paint strip, one chip per service on the
  ramp (skipping Warm Bronze), punched hole, price on the face. Swipe on phones.
- `home/TapeProcess.astro`: steps hanging off a tape measure that pulls out on
  scroll; a vertical ruler on phones.
- `home/HomeWords.astro`: the ink band, one big italic quote, three loose ones.
- `ServiceAreaCue.astro`: towns set large, home base first in Espresso italic.
- `FinalCta.astro` (every page): Walnut close, big headline, the logo's sprig
  drawing itself in behind.

Home rhythm: Walnut hero, linen, ink, linen, paper, linen, Walnut, ink footer.

## Process and FAQ (phase 2)

- `sections/ProcessSteps.astro`: the big sibling of the home tape. Desktop:
  a sticky rail on the left (the ink tape case, a vertical Oat tape, and the
  step index with each step's time estimate as jump links) beside the steps.
  The tape pulls out across the whole journey and the step in view lights up
  in the index, both CSS scroll-driven (named view timelines shared through
  `timeline-scope`, behind `@supports` and reduced motion). Phone: the rail
  is the journey at a glance above the stacked steps.
- `ProcessStep.astro` ("full"): one big moment per step. A huge Warm Bronze
  numeral (display type), the step's line drawing (draws itself on scroll),
  the time estimate on a sample tag, the title, the short description as a
  Zodiak lede, the full description, and the "Quick bullets" on a paint chip
  whose tone steps down the strip with the step (chips 1 to 4). The tier note
  hangs under the chip on a bronze rule.
- `sections/ProcessFaq.astro`: paper band, heading and "See the full FAQ"
  sticky on the left, questions on the right.
- `FaqAccordion.tsx` (shared with /e-design): no Radix. Each question is a
  button in an h3 with `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls`; every answer is in the
  static HTML, collapsed with a grid-row + `visibility` transition. The
  affordance is a ring with a plus that fills ink and turns to a minus.
  Questions in Zodiak, answers in General Sans at 64ch max. Styles live in
  `faq/faq-accordion.css`; grouping in `faq/group-faqs.ts`.
- `/faq`: a topic index (question count per topic) sticky on the left on
  desktop, a wrapping row of Linen pills on a phone, beside the grouped
  accordion. Index and accordion share `groupFaqs()`, so anchors always agree.

Process rhythm: linen hero, linen journey, paper FAQ, Walnut close, ink footer.

## Motion

- Every entrance enhances an already visible default. Nothing starts at
  opacity 0 behind a script-added class. Every animation sits inside
  `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`.
- Load: headline words rise (1s, quint-out, 45ms stagger), fan deck opens
  (1.6s, 70ms stagger), portrait settles from 110% to 100%.
- Scroll-driven, CSS only, behind `@supports (animation-timeline: view())`:
  paint chips settle, tape pulls out, the closing sprig draws.
- Easing: `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` for interaction,
  `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)` for entrances. No bounce.
- Screenshot reviews use reduced motion for the resting state: a full-page
  capture sits at scroll 0, so scroll-driven pieces show their "before" frame.

## Imagery

- Lead with Staci's brand shoot and tight material close-ups (paint, tile,
  trim, brass, fabric, flowers). Wide phone shots of rooms are used small, and
  never full-bleed under a scrim.
- Always set the hotspot in Sanity. The hero and the portraits crop around it.
- Captions are honest material notes on a sample tag ("Plum, satin finish").
  Never invent locations or project names.

## Not yet rebuilt (phase 2)

About, Services, E-Design, Contact, Privacy and the portfolio
templates still use the older section components, restyled only through the
shared tokens, fonts, buttons, header, footer and closing CTA. They are the
next pass, built against this document.
